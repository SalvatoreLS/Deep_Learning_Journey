# Deep Learning Projects Inspired by Coursera Specialization

This repository contains my personal implementations of various deep learning models and techniques. These projects are inspired by the concepts I learned during the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) on Coursera, offered by `deeplearning.ai` and taught by [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/).

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to document my journey in learning deep learning and to showcase the models and techniques I have implemented based on the knowledge acquired from the specialization. I have focused on understanding and recreating key concepts, and applying them to different datasets and problems.

## Contents
- **Logistic Regression**: A simple neural network implementation for binary classification.
- **Neural Network**: A neural network with one hidden layer.
- **Deep Neural Network**: A neural network with an higher number of layers.
- **Optimized NN**: Implemented optimization algorithms and parameters initialization to show the different results obtained.

### Work in Progress

Please note that this repository is a work in progress. I am planning to add more projects and implementations over time.

## Disclaimer

I decided not to publish the assignments and solutions from the Coursera Deep Learning Specialization to avoid any potential legal issues or violations of Coursera's academic integrity policies. The code and projects in this repository are my own implementations and are intended for learning and exploration purposes only.
